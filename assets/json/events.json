This is because frontend and backend developers often work hand in hand, and collaboration is fundamental to getting work done. So then why do we have such a strong separation between frontend development and the other parts of UX, such as design and research? Researchers, developers and designers often work together, but we rarely expect a developer to know anything about design or research. This is where full-stack UX comes in.",
