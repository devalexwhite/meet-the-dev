        "description": "As a frontend developer, its hard to avoid the necessity of knowing how backend systems work. Heck, you’ll probably even be required to gasp write backend code on occasion. This is because frontend and backend developers often work hand in hand, and collaboration is fundamental to getting work done. So then why do we have such a strong separation between frontend development and the other parts of UX, such as design and research? Researchers, developers and designers often work together, but we rarely expect a developer to know anything about design or research. This is where full-stack UX comes in.",
